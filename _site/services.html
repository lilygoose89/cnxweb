Help your customers to help themselves and improve both customer and employee satisfaction.

<br><br>
During this engagement, I will help you to set up a self-help center, and also train your team in how to manage and keep it up to date. I can also help you to link this resource to your live chat or help desk apps, and get you set up on both of these if required.

<br><br>
Whatever problem you're having, creating a customer journey map can be a powerful tool for insight. More than just a handy visual reference, it's a deep dive into the inner workings of your business, and what parts are, or are not serving your customers and your team. Clearly understanding the interactions and touch points which contribute to success or failure are critical if your business is going to continue to improve.
<br><br>
During this series of workshops, we'll define your customer personas to get into the mind of who your business serves and map every stage of their journey in order to troubleshoot your customer experience.
