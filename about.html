  <h3 class="editable pad-top-xs hi-lily">Hi, Iâ€™m Lily</h3>
  <h4 class="editable pad-top-xs pad-bottom-xs">I make websites, I'm obsessed with SaaS, and I have a habit of trying to fix other people's problems. I'm leaning in to the latter. I've created CNX Web because I want to turn my obsession with problem solving into a solution for your small business.<br /><br />Want to expand your business online but don't know how to get started? Need a better solution to your back-of-house problems but not good with technology? I'm here to help!</h4>
  <div class="editable"><p><br />Before I started traveling the world, I grew up in Chiang Mai, Thailand - the best city in the world. While my travels have taken me to over a dozen countries, I've always come back to the hometown I love.</p><p>I'm privileged to have completed my studies abroad, finishing my B.A. in Anthropology at The University of Florida, and my MSc. in Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Management at The Imperial College of London Business School.</p><p>I've gained incredible experience working at fast-growing start-ups, doing everything from printing photos on marshmallows, to helping fashion boutiques sell online for the first time, and convincing tech-averse lawyers to adopt a digital solution to their knowledge management problems.</p><p>When I briefly took over my family's 150-year-old bed &amp; breakfast, I created our very first website and brought our back-of-house systems into the 21st century, discovering first-hand the challenges of running a small business.</p><p>The problems I've encountered in my work have been diverse, and I've developed a powerful playbook built upon design thinking, agile methodologies, and a broad understanding of how to apply technology. What's even more useful though, is my ability to listen, empathize, and put myself in another's shoes, understanding their challenges on a deep level and making their problems my problems.</p><p>Now that I've moved back to Chiang Mai, I want to give the benefit of my knowledge and experience to you.</p><p>If you're an entrepreneur with passion for your business and customers that adore you, but you're struggling to get to the next level, I can help you. If you've been making do with cheap and D-I-Y solutions, but need a professional to whip things into shape, I've got your fix. If you need somebody committed but don't have the resources to bring somebody in full time, I'm here for you.</p></div>
