faq:
  - question: What price point do most projects start at?
    answer: >-
      One-time assignments (like audits, research, template design, copy-writing
      etc.) begin at ฿10,000, and are quoted based on the amount of research,
      time, and effort required to deliver the best result.<br /><br />Large
      projects or projects which take place over the course of several weeks or
      even months (such as going paperless, creating a customer help center, or
      launching a new product, etc.) begin at ฿50,000, and are also quoted based
      on scope.
  - question: Do you have any hourly pricing?
    answer: >-
      I prefer to charge a retainer based on the scope of a project so I can
      focus on delivering results instead of watching the clock. You're paying
      for the value of the finished product, not the time spent producing it.<br
      /><br />However, if you're looking for a quick consulting call, help with
      trouble-shooting, or have a small project that won't take more than a
      couple hours, my rate begins at ฿1500 per hour.
  - question: Why do your prices start at these amounts?
    answer: >-
      Clients come to me for well thought out solutions, not band-aids. They
      believe in paying for quality, and know the result is going to have a high
      ROI.<br /><br />I also prefer not to take on too many projects at a time
      so I can better focus my effort and attention. My rates reflect this level
      of care.
  - question: What is the typical process to get started?
    answer: >-
      When you first get in touch, I'll send you a quick intake survey to
      complete. This helps me better understand your business, your goals, and
      what I can do to help you reach them. If you provide enough information
      when you initially contact me, we might even be able to skip this.<br
      /><br />If it seems like a good fit for my skills, I’ll schedule a meeting
      so we can discuss the project in detail, I can learn more about your
      business, and your specific needs and goals.<br /><br />Once we've both
      agreed this is a good opportunity for both of us, I’ll send over an
      invoice + scope of work for the project. I require a 50% deposit up front,
      so once that's been paid, we’ll get started.
  - question: What happens then?
    answer: >-
      I aim to communicate closely, without becoming a distraction for you. I
      will report back to you on an agreed upon timeline, and my reports will
      include what work has been completed, what I need from you to keep moving
      forward, and what I expect to accomplish in the coming days.<br /><br
      />For small projects (such as audits, research, or copywriting) I try to
      have these wrapped up in a week or less.<br /><br />Once the work is
      complete, I'll send you a final invoice for the outstanding balance and
      deliver the project once it's paid.
  - question: When can you start?
    answer: >-
      I generally work first-come-first-serve, so the sooner we can start the
      conversation, the better! If you need me IMMEDIATELY, I’ll move you to the
      top of my PRIORITY list, but a 20% fee will be added for the VIP
      treatment.
  - question: How do you accept payments?
    answer: >-
      I accept payments via PayPal, Promptpay, or bank transfer (within
      Thailand).<br />If you're having trouble with payment options, please call me at (061) 279-1306.
