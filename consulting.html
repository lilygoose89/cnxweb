faq:
  - question: What price point do most projects start at?
    answer: One-time assignments (like writing, copyediting, social media audits, etc.) begin at ฿15,000, and are quoted based on the amount of research, time, and effort required to deliver the best result.<br /><br />Large projects or packages (like brand voice guidelines, brand storytelling + launch strategy, product photography, etc.) begin at $2500, and are also quoted based on scope.
  - question: Do you have any hourly pricing?
    answer: I prefer to charge a retainer based on the scope of a project and the deliverables/results. You're paying for the value of the finished product, not the time spent producing it.<br />However, if you're looking for a quick consulting call or have a small project that won't take more than a couple hours, I begin at ฿1500 per hour.
  - question: Why do your prices start at these amounts?
    answer: Clients want to work with me because I deliver results. They believe in paying for quality, and know the result is going to have a high ROI. If you're looking to get fast food prices and mediocre results, you're in the wrong place.
  - question: What is your new client onboarding process?
    answer: If the project is on site, we'll be communicating closely. However, if we're working together remotely, I never want you to feel like you have to check in. My goal is always to keep you informed, and I always add a reporting cadence to every client contract, so there are no communication issues. My reports typically include what work has been completed, what I need from you to keep moving forward, and what I expect to accomplish in the coming days. If you prefer to do this over the phone or Google Hangout, that works great as well! For small projects, I’ll often be finished before you can even think to ask how things are going. Once the final product is delivered, I’ll send over a final invoice for the outstanding balance.
  - question: What happens then?
    answer: Each one of my clients goes through an easy three-step process. When you first contact me, I'll shoot you a quick intake survey to complete. This helps me better understand your needs, your core objectives, and what I can do to help you reach them. Sometimes this is even unnecessary if you provide enough detail up front. If it seems like a good fit for my skills, I’ll schedule an intro call, so we can discuss the project in detail, I can learn more about your business, and your specific needs/goals. Once we've both said, "Heck Yes! Let's work together!" I’ll send over an invoice + contract for the project. I require a 50% deposit up front, so once that's been paid, we’ll get started.
  - question: When can you start?
    answer: I generally request a 1-2 week lead time for new projects. The sooner we can start the conversation, the better. If you need me IMMEDIATELY, I’ll move you to the top of my PRIORITY list, but a 15% fee will be added for the VIP treatment.
  - question: How do you accept payments?
    answer: I accept payments via PayPal or SquareCash. If you choose to use a CC, a 3% fee will be added to cover the transaction fee cost.
